X-301 is a discord bot with the purpose of make your life easier while playing Lost Ark.  

With X-301 you can get information about LA gathered from [Papunika](https://papunika.com).

Right now there's only one command which shows map information from [Papunika's website](https://papunika.com).

Future plans include creating commands and/or improvements to show guides, continents tomes, items, etc.
